	"After filling up his backpack, Mason is faced with an important decision he has to make of where he would go next.  His first option would be to go to the junkyard, a relatively empty place where Mason usually finds his gadgets and gizmos.  He knows that if he can make it past the electric fence there, he would be safe from the neighbors chasing him.  Mason could also escape to his only friend, John's house, where he would be able to hide from the neighbors.  His final choice would be to hide in the sewers, where Mason hopes to lose his prosecutors, while also using the sewer tunnels to navigate the city. Problem 2: Run for the junkyard, Problem 3: Go to John's house, Problem 4: Hide in the sewers",
	"Just as the lights all meet at the gates again, Mason seizes this opportunity and climbs the fence, crossing it just as a light was passing him. Now that Mason was safe from all his prosecutors, he would need to devise a plan to stop the Digital Eradication Act. Proceed to problem 5",

Upon further investigation in John's house, Mason found a quickly written note on the table, in John's horrible handwriting.  It wrote: *To anyone reading this: Due to the unforseen circumstances of the DE Act, I have been taking in by federal officers.  Please send help --*. Proceed to problem 6",
