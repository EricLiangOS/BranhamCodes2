	<h1>About The Problems</h1>
	<p>Welcome to <em>The Trials of Bits and Bytes</em>, a choose your own adventure game full of programming puzzles to help sharpen your skills. Work your way through problems, with branching paths determining which action you perform.
		Inspired by <em>Advent of Code</em>, the problems in TTBB donâ€™t require deep programming knowledge.  You can approach questions from any angle and even brute force the questions without even touching code, but each problem is guarenteed to have a programmable solution that can run in under 5 seconds.
		You can test a few questions out to get the general feel of things, but feel free to create an account to keep track of your progress!
