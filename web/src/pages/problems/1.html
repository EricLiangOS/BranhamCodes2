Welcome to <em>The Trials of Bits and Bytes</em>, a choose your own adventure game full of programming puzzles to help sharpen your skills.
Work your way through problems, with branching paths determining which action you perform.
Inspired by <em>Advent of Code</em>, the problems in TTBB donâ€™t require deep programming knowledge.
You can approach questions from any angle and even brute force the questions without even touching code,
but each problem is guarenteed to have a programmable solution that can run in under 5 seconds.
To start your adventure here is your first task.
You will recieve a list of numbers. The first number n, will tell you how many numbers are in that list. The next n lines each cotain a random number
in the range [0, 1000]. Please find the sum of all these numbers.
