After some brief evaluation, Mason decides that hiding in the sewers will be very beneficial.  It would allow him to access all the major locations in Omni
and provide protection from the mob that's hunting for his head.  The average citizen of Omni was dirt poor, barely being able to afford the common necessities
of life, such as food and water.  They had to resort to building homes out of scrap and wearing the ragged, tattered clothes of the wealthy upper-class, so
20,000 bits, even when split upon a group of 25 people, would still mean the world to them.
<br>
As Mason fell deep into thought, the clanging of trash lids brought Mason's attention back to his current situation, and Mason quickly scurried out of sight
from the people behind him.  Although the sewer gates were designed with a sophisticated lock mechanism, the design was a product of Mason's dad, so
he was familiar with the inner workings of the lock and easily bypassed challenge, into the sewers.
<br>
The sewer tunnels reeked of rotten food and molding bags of trash.  Grayish water rose above the knees, making it very difficult
to traverse the systems，but Mason continued anyway, knowing that there's no looking back.
<br>
The sewer system consists of a total of N locations (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), which are known to be labeled from 1 to N.  There are M sewer tunnels that Mason connect each
location with another location and these sewer tunnels can be traversed both ways.
<br>
For example, in a sewer system of 5 locations with the 4 connections between 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 4 and 5, and 3 and 5, the sewage system might look like the
following graph:
<pre>
  1           3 ---- 4
   \           \    /
    \           \  /
     2            5
</pre>
Mason is currently at location 1 and must consider which locations he can get to from his current path.  In this example, the only location Mason can reach
is location 2.  Help Mason determine which locations are possible to travel to by taking these sewer tunnels.
<br>
INPUT:
<br>
The first line contains two integers N and M.  The next M lines each contain two integers a and b which describe a sewer tunnel connection between locations
a and b.
<br>
OUTPUT:
<br>
Enter the sum of all possible locations Mason can reach, excluding his current location at 1.
